Problem Statement -

A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The chocolate packets here 
represent an array of N number of integer values. The task is to find the empty packets(0) 
of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array).

Example 1 :

N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0].

There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should 
be pushed towards the end of the array

Input :

8  - Value of N

[4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] - Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by 
newline

Output:

4 5 1 9 5 0 0 0

Example 2:

Input:

6 â€” Value of N.

[6,0,1,8,0,2] - Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], While input each element is separated by 
newline

Output:

6 1 8 2 0 0'''
