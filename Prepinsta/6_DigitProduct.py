'''
A supermarket maintains a pricing format for all its products. A value N is printed on each product. When the scanner reads the value N on the item, the product of all the digits in the value N is the price of the item. The task here is to design the software such that given the code of any item N the product (multiplication) of all the digits of value should be computed(price).

Example 1:

Input :

5244 -> Value of N

Output :
160 -> Price 

Explanation:

From the input above 

Product of the digits 5,2,4,4

5*2*4*4= 160

Hence, output is 160.

        code //= 10

    return price

code = 5244
print(price(code))
