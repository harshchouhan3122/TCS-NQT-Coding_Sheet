In this article we will learn a very popular algorithm for "Rotate array by K elements : Block Swap Algorithm".

Problem Statement: Given an array of n size, rotate the array by k elements using the Block Swap Algorithm.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5} K=2
Output: {3,4,5,1,2}
Explanation: Rotate the array to right by 2 elements.

Example 2:
Input: N = 7, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} K=3
Output: {4,5,6,7,1,2,3}
Explanation: Rotate the array to right by 3 elements.
