Problem Statement: Given an array, we have to find the smallest element in the array.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = {2,5,1,3,0};
Output: 0
Explanation: 0 is the smallest element in the array. 

Example2: 
Input: arr[] = {8,10,5,7,9};
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest element in the array.
Solution
Disclaimer: Donâ€™t jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

Solution1: Sorting

Intuition: We can sort the array in ascending order, hence the smallest element will be at the 0th index. 

Approach: 

Sort the array in ascending order.
Print the 0th index.
DryRun: 

Before sorting: arr[] = {2,5,1,3,0};

After sorting: arr[] = {0,1,2,3,5};

Hence answer : arr[0] = 0

    for i in arr:
        if i < minVal:
            minVal = i
    return minVal

arr = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))
print(smallest(arr))
