Problem Statement: Perfect Number. Write a program to find whether a number is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is defined as a number that is the sum of its proper divisors ( all its positive divisors excluding itself). 

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: n=6
Output: 6 is a perfect number

Example 2:
Input: n=15
Output: 15 is not a perfect number

Example 3:
Input: n=28
Output: 28 is a perfect number
Reason:
For 6 and 28 , the sum of their proper divisors (1+2+3) and (1+4+7+14) is equal to the respective numbers and for 15 it is not.
